Large part of the code in the RuDD library are based on the original work by
Jorn Lind-Nielsen on the BuDDy C library. I include the original license for
this work below, together with a list of the original authors.

While the current implementation of RuDD adds some original work, I expect every
redistribution to include the present NOTICE and acknowledge that some source
files and examples have been copied and adapted from the *BuDDy* Binary Decision
Diagrams Library, Package v2.4, Copyright (C) 1996-2002 by Jorn Lind-Nielsen
